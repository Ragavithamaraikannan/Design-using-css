    <p>Of course,there are companies out there that have great web writers internally,but most don't.And the thought of a company turning a great website content strategy (that we slaved over)into an effective "brochure site"gives me heartburn.But sometimes you have to pick your battles.</p>

Here is a template we like to use,and an explanantion of what's included.</p>
