    <h1>A Template for killer Website Content</h1>

<p>Over the years of developing websites for cilents,I've learned that the age-old adage,<span>"If you want it done right,you gotta do it yourself," </span>can be a two-way street.</p>

<p>Of course,there are companies out there that have great web writers internally,but most don't.And the thought of a company turning a great website content strategy (that we slaved over)into an effective <span>"brochure site"</span>gives me heartburn.But sometimes you have to pick your battles.</p>

<p>in cases where we give in and let the cilent take the content reins,we at least want to make sure they are equipped with a template that gives them a flighting chance to produce effective website content that drives action. Here is a template we like to use,and an explanantion of what's included.</p>
